# An amazing piece of technology.
## What? Amazing? Technology? "I want some of that" - you probably.
This is a game that is just the best thing you can imagine, don't believe it? Well don't take my word for it.
"This is ok" - My grandpa.

"You spent 7 hours on this..?" - my ~~best~~ friend.

"Get a job" - hobo.

And there are a lot more review just like these.

You are probably guessing, how on gosh darn earth can I play this cool and amazing game of video. Well guess no more, presenting (*drum roll*) a **_TUTORIAL!_**

First you need npm. Once you have a fresh pair of npm (I know this process might make you impatient ("That joke is terrible" - me)) clone this git repository and once in correct directory run these commands in bash terminal (or cmd if you don't like fun): 
```
npm install
npm run start
```
 What? You're done? Wow, you've finished so fast! ("That's what she said" - Michael Scott)

 All you need now is to launch your browser. It should work on Chrome. If you prefer other browsers, this game should work. But if by chance you use IE or safari and it does not work, go get yourself a normal browser :)
